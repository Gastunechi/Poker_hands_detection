# Yolov8-works
This repository contains everything you need to detect poker hands via YOLOv8: training notebook, model weight, scripts for real-time video recognition and inference with webcam.

This GitHub repository is dedicated to a project for poker hand detection using the YOLOv8 computer vision model. The project includes everything needed to configure, train and deploy a system for recognizing different poker hands from real-time images captured by webcam.

Deposit contents :

Training notebook: A Jupyter notebook where I carried out the training of the YOLOv8 model, detailing every step of the process, from data preparation to hyperparameter optimization.
Model weights: The weights of the trained model, ready to be used for detection, enabling fast and accurate recognition of poker hands.
Recognition function: A Python file (PokerHandFunction.py) containing the function developed to recognize poker hands from images processed by the model.
Video inference code: A Python script (Poker_Hands.py) that uses the webcam to capture video in real time and apply the poker hand detection model.
